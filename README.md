# misresultados-tools

## About

This repository contains tools I find useful for interacting with [misresultados.com](https://misresultados.com/), a healthcare results platform.

## Available Tools

- **[CLI Tool](./cli/)** - Command-line interface for fetching and downloading medical results programmatically.

- **[Browser Extension](./extension/)** - TODO

## Why build this?

 I was tired of having to clunkily re-enter my last names and date of birth every time I wanted to check my lab results. I also wanted to test out Claude Code's current capabilities, so this served as a fun weekend project to familiarize myself with the world of "supervised, agentic-first" development.

## Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with MisResultados, Assertus or AbartysHealth. I did work at AbartysHealth in 2018-2019, but these tools were developed by myself, primarily for my own use.
