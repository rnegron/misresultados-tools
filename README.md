# misresultados-tools

This repository contains tools I find useful for interacting with [misresultados.com](https://misresultados.com/), a healthcare results platform.

## Available Tools

- **[CLI Tool](./cli/)** - Command-line interface for fetching and downloading medical results programmatically.

- **[Browser Extension](./extension/)** - Firefox extension for auto-filling patient data.

## Why build this?

 I was tired of having to clunkily re-enter my last names and date of birth every time I wanted to check my lab results. I also wanted to test out Claude Code's current capabilities, so this served as a fun weekend project to familiarize myself with the world of "supervised, agentic-first" development.

## Feedback welcome!

If you end up using these tools, I'd genuinely enjoy to hear about your experience. Whether you've found them helpful, run into issues, or have ideas for improvements, your feedback is welcome.

I am not affiliated with MisResultados, Assertus or AbartysHealth. I did work at AbartysHealth in 2018-2019, but these tools were developed by myself, primarily for my own use.
